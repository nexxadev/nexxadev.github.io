### 🧠 About Me

I'm a hands-on builder who blends **code** and **creativity** to bring interactive tech ideas to life. From camera-based gesture interfaces to networked communication apps, I focus on accessible, real-time systems that solve real-world challenges. Whether it's **ESP32-powered wearables** or **AIR-KEYBOARD**, I love pushing the boundaries of software and hardware together.
